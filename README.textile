h1. PrettyDiff Ruby Gem

A tiny library for generating pretty HTML listings for Unified Diff format inputs. Heavily used in "Beanstalk":http://beanstalkapp.com application.

h2. Installation

<pre><code>
gem install pretty_diff
</code></pre>

h2. Example

A quick example will tell it all:

<pre><code>
udiff = File.read("awesome.diff")
pretty = PrettyDiff::Diff.new(udiff)
pretty.to_html
</code></pre>

That's about it.

h2. Features

The library is really easy to read and change. All HTML is concentrated in a single place â€” html_generator.rb; so it's very easy to customize the output to suit your needs.

By default PrettyDiff will generate HTML that can be easily colored with a CSS that you can find here.

PrettyDiff will generate 2 columns of line numbers, as it's usually done for diffs. These columns are copy & paste safe, means that line numbers won't be copied when you copy diff contents.

Tabs will be automatically converted to double spaces.

h2. Stuff To Do

The test suit can be somewhat improved.

h2. History

The library was extracted from Beanstalk during the awesome Wildbit Open Source Fridays.
